# The .NET Codex

> *Because real understanding doesn’t come with a job title.*

Welcome! This repository is a growing collection of articles, essays, and technical deep dives written by Gary McNickle, as part of an ongoing series called The .NET Codex — a guide to the lost lore of .NET development.

This series explores the foundational knowledge that every aspiring .NET developer should know — but often doesn’t, or learns far too late. Think of it as the stuff you won’t find in a beginner tutorial, but that makes everything else click once you do.

Each article is self-contained in its own folder, and includes:
- A Markdown article (`.md`)
- Code samples or demos (usually in C#, PowerShell, or Python)
- Licensing information
