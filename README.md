# The .NET Codex

> *Because real understanding doesn‚Äôt come with a job title.*

Welcome! This repository is a growing collection of articles, essays, and technical deep dives written by Gary McNickle, as part of an ongoing series called The .NET Codex ‚Äî a guide to the lost lore of .NET development.

This series explores the foundational knowledge that every aspiring .NET developer should know ‚Äî but often doesn‚Äôt, or learns far too late. Think of it as the stuff you won‚Äôt find in a beginner tutorial, but that makes everything else click once you do.

Each article is self-contained in its own folder, and includes:
- A Markdown article (`.md`)
- Code samples or demos (usually in C#, PowerShell, or Python)
- Licensing information
